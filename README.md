###### About this project
The idea behind this project was quite a simple one. Make a complete mapping of an actual interview/job application type of an event, but completely online.

The whole process starts as soon as the admin(ROLE_ADMIN) creates a job oppening. All the candidates(every visitor to the page) has the ability to see a list of all the available positions. There are two ways of applying to these positions.

###### First way :
Click the button "Apply with a form". The button brings you to a new page where you are presented with a simple form, which asks you about your data. The usual name, surname, e-mail address stuff. After that you click apply, and as soon as we process the application, you are getting an e-mail verification about the successfull application. In that email you are given an ID number, with which you are able to check your progress on our site at any given time.

###### Second way:
By clicking the other button, titled as "Apply with a mail", you are presented with a form that is filled up(consider it as a guideline). The form is there to help you structure your e-mail propertly. As soon as you check all the important parts of your message, feel free to send it to us. And the rest is the same. As soon as we process the application,  you are getting an e-mail verification about the successfull application. In that email you are given an ID number, with which you are able to check your progress on our site at any given time.

###### About the ROLE_ADMIN:
The ROLE_ADMIN is a position which has a lot of priviledges, and a lot of responsibility at the same time. So first and most important, you have to log in to your account, so the system knows that you have the priviledges. After you are logged in, you are presented with a so called "Admin Panel", basically an interface where you can do it all.

* Create job oppening
* List view of all the applications for a given job oppening
* Ability to review all of the applications and interact with those
* Ability to advance the given application through the stages, or simply drop it if it is not good enough
* Option to test the "Ticketing System"(portion of the site for checking the progress of application by the applicant himself)
* Option to send individual or group emails, with or without attachments

For the testing purposes of this project, we have only one ROLE_ADMIN account.
