# Recruitment Process Project

---

This project is a simulation of a whole Recruitment process.
It all starts with sending an email, or filling up a form.
After that, we create an application for the given information
that you provide, or we extract from the received email.
##### You apply by filling in :
* Name
* Surname
* E-Mail address
* Mobile number
* Age
* You can also provide some extra comment/description

---
The application also has **Admin Panel** where you can manage
all created applications. **Admin** has an option to:
* Send mail to given applicant(with or without an attachment)
* Make the applicant advance to a next phase
* Drop applicant
* Select multiple applicants to advance or drop
